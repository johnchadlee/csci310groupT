== Usage ==
To run JUnit tests:
Right click project -> Run As -> "Maven test".

To run JUnit tests with coverage:
We are using Eclipse's built-in coverage reporting tool for this.
Expand src/test/java, right click the "csci310" package -> Coverage As -> JUnit Test

To host your web app: 
Go to "Run Configurations", run the "run" configuration.
Open Google Chrome and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the application.
You can stop the web server by clicking the red "stop" button in the console window.

To run Cucumber tests:
Make sure the webserver is running when you run the Cucumber tests (using the steps for hosting the web app above).
Go to "Run Configurations", run the "cucumber" configuration.
